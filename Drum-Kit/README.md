## Learning

In this project, the following DOM topics were used and implemented:

- **Event Listeners**: Used to detect and handle user interactions such as button clicks and key presses.
- **Audio Playback**: Utilized the HTML5 `<audio>` element to play drum sounds.
- **Class Manipulation**: Added and removed CSS classes to provide visual feedback when a drum is played.
- **Data Attributes**: Used data attributes to store custom data on HTML elements, such as the key associated with each drum sound.
- **DOM Traversal**: Navigated the DOM to access and manipulate elements based on user interactions.
